/**
 *
 *     This parameter controls text normalization with four modes: 'auto', 'on', 'apply_english' and 'off'.
 *     When set to 'auto', the system will automatically decide whether to apply text normalization
 *     (e.g., spelling out numbers). With 'on', text normalization will always be applied, while
 *     with 'off', it will be skipped. 'apply_english' is the same as 'on' but will assume that text is in English.
